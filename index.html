    <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Web Accessibility is a right that every person should have. When the internet is as used as it is today to not have a way
        for every person in existence to be able to use it. Computers and the Internet are something that we will never be able 
        to get rid of, from jobs to school to personal use they are used in someones life multiple times a day. For someone to not 
        have access to a whole world outside of reality is probably more debilitating than the actual disability they deal with. Now 
        these can be used by everyone and they are so important to make the web a universal tool that anyone can use.
